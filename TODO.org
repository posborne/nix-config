#+title: Nix Config Todo

This is a general collection of stuff that I might want to look into, generally
in priority order to improve the overall completeness of this whole nix
configuration thing.

* Applications to different systems

- [ ] Get home-manager setup going on Darwin for personal laptop
- [ ] Install "on the metal" on main Ryzen rig
- [ ] Setup headless virtualized system on NAS rig.
- [ ] Setup headless docker sysetm on NAS rig.

* Improvements to home configuration

** Dotfiles

- [X] bashrc config to nix (decided to not do)
- [X] gitconfig full to nix
- [ ] tmux conf to nix
- [ ] zsh/env configuartion to nix (fully)
- [ ] Alacritty configuration

* Security/Secrets

- [ ] Get OpenSSH configuration fully locked down
- [ ] Research sops-nix, probably deploy
- [ ] Automatic setup of full 1password integration ( e.g. GH Key )
- [ ] Look into fprintd fingerprint hardware/integration.
